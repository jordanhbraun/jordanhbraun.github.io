*A collaboration with [Anita Su](http://anitasu.wix.com/anita-su)*

A project reminiscent of childhood memories transformed an empty room into a dreamlike environment. In a 400 sq ft room, we created a fully immersive art piece by hanging cloud and sheep mobiles from the ceiling. The piece itself is not directly interactive, but as a whole works as an interactive space. There are lights on every cloud, and a number of them are programmed to vary the brightness of the lights. Some mobiles are built with motors that gradually alter the height of sheep.

Anita casted and glazed over 100 porcelain sheep by hand.

I programmed several Arduino Nano microcontrollers to control the pulsating lights in the clouds as well as the servo motors which gradually raised and lowered the sheep.

I also designed and built the frames for all of the mobiles, then wired the lights and servo motors. Anita then hand-sewed polyester fluff to the frames and hung the sheep from fishing line.
