Piracy drives progress and it should be celebrated. Piracy takes old stodgey business models and forces outdated industries to innovate. Before Napster came along, the music industry had done nothing innovative since the advent of the radio. Albums were becoming outrageously priced, and the prices would have continued to rise if not for an outside threat like piracy. Thanks to Napster we have the iTunes store, Pandora, and Spotify. Without piracy, the industry would have never agreed to allow their product to be streamed for a reasonable price on a service like Spotify. Similarly, the TV and movie industy allowing Netflix to stream their products is a response to the Pirate Bay. By forcing the big industries to plug sinking ships, we are left with more options, better prices, and better services. Piracy is the consumer's version of a union.
