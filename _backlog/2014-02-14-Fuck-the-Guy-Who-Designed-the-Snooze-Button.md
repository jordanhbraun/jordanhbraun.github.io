**I took control of my life today.**

I have been struggling, off and on, with the snooze button for as long as I can remember. My old man calls it a self-inflicted torture device. He’s right, but still I snoozed... until today. I’ve tried all sorts of schemes to beat the habit. I’ve left myself mean notes and taped them to the snooze button. I’ve moved the alarm away from my bed. I’ve tried making myself do jumping jacks when I get out of bed. But I could never fully quit the snooze. Today I took control. I decided not to fight the button any more, I killed it forever. I took apart my alarm clock and ripped that fucker out. No more snoozing. It never should have been part of the clock in the first place.

**Design ethics**

I often think about my social responsibilities as a designer. A good design decision can carry a lot of weight. We are manipulators, psychologists, and social engineers. A big part of our job is to understand motivations and turn those motivations into behaviors. That’s a big responsibility, and I think we should quit taking it so lightly.

Facebook notifications, Netflix autoplay, the snooze button... I’m opting out. I’m opting out of using them. I’m opting of designing them. These features are designed to manipulate our behaviors at our weakest moments. When we crave social interaction, when we’re having a hard time getting motivated, when we are too tired to turn down 10 more minutes of sleep. I want to use products that serve me and make me better. I was to design products the enable people, not distract them.

Understanding how to manipulate motivations in order to create behaviors can be a great thing. As designers, we can make people go to the gym, stay focused, spend more time with their kids, save more money... we can do anything! Let’s create experiences that push people to be better.
