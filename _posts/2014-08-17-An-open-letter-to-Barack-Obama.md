President Obama,

You could go down in history as this nation's most disappointing president. Your campaign inspired the people of the United States, young and old, but you have not delivered. When we voted for "change" we did not mean "change your mind."

You have about 2 years left in your term, here is a list of items I have prepared that could help you save face. You do not need to complete this list, but I believe that completing even just one or two of these items could be the saving grace of your presidency.
***
####End military involvement in the Middle-East
None of your voters were voting for war. You promised to end the wars in Iraq and Afghanistan, and while you may have done so on paper, we still have boots on the ground and dollars going out the door. It would be nice to stabilize the region, but we are $17,600,000,000,000 in debt. We can't afford it.

####Close down the Guantanamo Bay Detention Camp
Guantanamo Bay is disgusting. The eagle is symbolic for the United States because we are supposed to soar, not stoop to the bottom. If we can not treat prisoners humanely, even under difficult circumstances, then we are no longer an honorable country. Please restore standards, ethics, and honor.

####Pardon Edward Snowden and Chelsea Manning
You promised a transparent government and you failed to deliver. They only did what you said you would do; what the people voted for. They looked above the law, and did what was right.

####Reign in the NSA
The constant warrantless surveillence of the American people is a disgrace. You promised us that you would end the warrantless wire-tapping that was discovered under the Bush administration, but instead you have expanded it. Do you understand the difference between tyranny and liberty?

####Protect Net Neutrality
ISPs basically have a government granted monopoly, they don't need more control over the Internet. Either break up the monopoly and force them to compete, or draft legislation that protects net neutrality. Growth in the technology sector is not something this country can afford to lose.
***
Please do not make excuses. George W. Bush's regime could have made any of this happen. I don't think you have what it takes to stand up and push through legislation that you believe in. Stop playing politics and start working on making this country better.

Sincerely,

Jordan H. Braun
