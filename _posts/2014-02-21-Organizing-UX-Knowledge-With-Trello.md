The design process can be messy and chaotic. I'm a fan of any tool or procedure that helps me clean up and focus my workflow. I use a method of organizing knowledge in UX projects that I find to be simple and valuable, especially when working collaboratively.

First, I try to get everyone involved in the project thinking in terms of unknowns, assumptions, and facts. Just doing this does wonders for communication, planning, and prioritization. Our goal will be to turn unknowns into assumptions, then into facts. I find [Trello][1] to be the perfect tool for organizing and manipulating this information. I create 3 lists: Unknowns, Assumptions, and Facts. Then I create cards in each list for pieces information relevant to the project.
</br>
</br>


**Unknowns:** We don't know.

User behaviors that we don't understand and questions that we have about the problem we're solving.
</br>
</br>


**Assumptions:** We think we know.

Assumptions and predictions that we have made about the user. They are usually related to the user's motivations or how the user will interact with the product.
</br>
</br>


**Facts:** We know.

The only way to make it on to this list is through testing, no excuses. Scientific facts are permitted, but common social assumptions should be tested and validated.
</br>
</br>

**Bringing it all home**
Cards can be moved from unknowns to assumptions to facts through observation, testing, and validation. Follow the scientific method (*See post:* [Design Science: Testing is the process][2].) Unknowns should be observed and hypotheses (assumptions) should be formed. Assumptions should be tested and either turned into facts or back into unknowns.

Trello has great iOS, Android, and Windows 8 apps. Collaboration is easy. Modifying cards and dragging them from list to list is simple. You can make comments on cards and attach files. It's everything that I love about white boards and post-it notes, but digital.

*(Disclaimer: I currently have no affiliation with Trello, but we would love for that to change.)*
