<p>Empeopled is a content aggregation and discussion site. The most interesting thing about Empeopled is it’s “goverance” features.</p>

<p>Designing Empeopled was a collaborative effort. I was involved in user research, prototyping, interaction design, and UI design. The project was fast paced, fun, and low budget. They are my #1 Favorite All-Time Client. Great guys to work with, had a blast.</p>

<p><strong>Research</strong></p>

<p>The long-term goal of Empeopled is to create self-governing virtual city-states. Our initial sights were set on creating a place where people could have intellectual and deep discussions. We set out to learn how deep discussions work, where they happen, and why they don’t happen on the internet.</p>

<p>We learned that great discussions happen when their is intelligent moderation, a topic worth discussing, a safe environment, and feedback from peers. So, that’s what we tried to build for version one.</p>

<p><strong>A Virtual Society</strong></p>

<p>If the long-term goal was to create a virtual society, we wanted to start to lay the groundwork. We chose a newspaper as our metaphor and inspiration. Newspapers are clean and simple. They are a container for a variety of types of information. The purpose of newspaper is to keep citizens informed and engaged, so it seemed like a perfect fit.</p>

<p>We then started exploring all sorts of other features that riffed on the idea of a virtual society. We created a bitcoin treasury, elections, polls, and a variety of other features. Iterations were fast and fun. If we had a decent idea, we threw it out there and saw what happened.</p>

<p><strong>Current State</strong></p>

<p>Empeopled continues to function and grow. There is a tight knit and engaged community. It is an experimental concept, and we continue to iterate.</p>
