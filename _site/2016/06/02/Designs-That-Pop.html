    <h2>Designs that Pop!</h2>
    <p>Jun 2, 2016</p>
  </header>

  <article class="post-content">
    <p>My blog posts and work samples focus almost entirely on function, and rarely mention form. I don’t often write about visual design, because people more qualified than me have already done most of the heavy lifting. I try to focus my effort on creating value by solving problems that are unique to the project I am working on.</p>

<p>This doesn’t mean that I don’t appreciate, enjoy, and strive for beautiful designs. My gut and my idols (Buckminster Fuller, Dieter Rams, Christopher Alexander, Charles Eames, etc), seem to agree that form synthesizes around function.</p>

<blockquote>
  <p>“When I am working on a problem, I never think about beauty but when I have finished, if the solution is not beautiful, I know it is wrong.”</p>

  <p>-R. Buckminster Fuller</p>
</blockquote>

<p><br /></p>

<p><strong>Principles and Best Practices</strong></p>

<p>Many things that you might think of as “designs that pop” or aesthetic decisions, are actually decisions about function. Beautiful typography is a function of legibility. Font size, line height, margins, and weight are all dictated by the human eye and visual processing. Typographic principles guide us towards the proper typography for the job. Principles exist for layout, color, logos… you name it! Within these principles there’s some wiggle room for style, but it’s no different than the wiggle room engineers enjoy within their functional principles or that accountants enjoy within the Generally Accepted Accounting Principles (GAAP).</p>

<p><img src="/images/badtypography.png" alt="Bad Typography" /></p>

<p><img src="/images/badtypography2.png" alt="Bad Typography 2" /></p>

<p>Believe it or not, these sites prioritize form over function. The designers obviously prioritized their own misguided aesthetic preferences over legibility and usability. The result is both ugly and unusable.
<br />
<br />
<br /></p>

<p><img src="/images/goodtypography.png" alt="Good Typography" /></p>

<p><img src="/images/goodtypography1.png" alt="Good Typography 2" /></p>

<p>These designers let function dictate form. The result is legibility, usability, and focus. They also happen to be beautiful, and are often used as examples of companies that value design. Apple and Medium don’t try to reinvent the wheel. They use tried and true design principles for legibility, usability, and focus. 
<br /></p>

<p>Design is a science with some art sprinkled on top, not the other way around.</p>

<p><br /></p>

<p><strong>Cleanliness and Simplicity</strong></p>

<p>Humans like things that we can understand, and we’re afraid of things that we don’t. When things are clean and simple, they are easier to understand. When they are cluttered and complex, they are more difficult to understand. Clutter and complexity create fear, anxiety, and distraction. Those things discourage use. This doesn’t mean that a design can’t be colorful, playful, or even flashy. It just means that we should be mindful of things like white space, grids, and the amount of content displayed.</p>

<p><img src="/images/dirtyengine.png" alt="Dirty Engine" /></p>

<p><img src="/images/cleanengine.png" alt="Clean Engine" /></p>

<p>Which of these engines do you think runs better? Which would you prefer to interact with? Which one is more aesthetically pleasing? Unless you’re diehard for Ford over GM, the answer to all of those questions is probably the second image. It’s aesthetics don’t make it run better. The fact that it has been meticulously built and maintained to run well (function) makes it pretty (form). This also makes it easier to work on and easier to learn about. It is inviting and isn’t as scary to explore, and that is a good thing in interface design.</p>

<p><br /></p>

<p><strong>Trends in Design</strong></p>

<p>Design trends are largely dictated by cultural changes, technological advances, and scientific discovery. Design trends are not created by a consortium of creatives. Why are light font-weights and color gradients in style right now? Because our screen technology advanced to the pixel density necessary for thin lines and color gradients to look smooth. Why is skeuomorphism going away? Because of a cultural change where digital natives no longer need visual cues to a real world equivalent to understand an interface. Flashy sites were popular when the Internet was new and exciting. Now minimalist designs cut through the noise.</p>

<p><img src="/images/ornateteapot.png" alt="Ornate Teapot" /></p>

<p><img src="/images/minimalteapot.png" alt="Minimalist Teapot" /> </p>

<p>Before the industrial revolution, fancy engraved metal goods were all the rage. The craftsmanship required to create these ornate pieces signaled quality and attention to detail. New manufacturing techniques made it cheap and easy to create ornate designs with metal. Eventually, manufacturers realized that they could cover up impurities in the materials with ornamentation. Consumers caught on, and contemporary minimalist designs became the new face of luxury while overly ornate designs are viewed as tacky or gaudy.</p>

<p>It’s worth noting that neither of these design trends are “wrong”. Each seems to be a well made and well designed teapot that serves its function well. They fit the manufacturing practices and cultural norms of their times. </p>

<p><br /></p>

<p><strong>How I Think About Visual Design</strong></p>

<p>My focus as a designer has always been on things like users, features, product focus, and the system as a whole. Often, these concerns overlap with visual design decisions. I know that if I truly understand the users and the product, then the visuals will be easy. Paying attention to what I’ve outlined above: <em>principles and best practices, simplicity, and design trends</em> means that 95% of the visual decisions have been made for me. If I am designing for a platform with a strong design language, such as iOS or Android, then there are even more principles to help guide the visual design. If I am designing for a company with strong branding and style guidelines, then there are even less decisions to be made.</p>

<p>The remaining visual design decisions come down to what I think is best for the project. Ideally, this is guided by empathy for the user, but there might be some personal preference sprinkled in. </p>

<p>In short, I care very much about creating beautiful designs. If I do a good job understanding the function, then the form will manifest itself beautifully.</p>
