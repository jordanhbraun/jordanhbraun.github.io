    <h2>Privacy in Smart Cities</h2>
    <p>Jun 22, 2015</p>
  </header>

  <article class="post-content">
    <p><strong>“Smart Cities” mostly means “Smart Governments”</strong></p>

<p>Tech and local governments are very gung-ho about “smart cities” right now. The basic concepts that add up to a smart city are connectivity, open data, and sensor-driven intelligence/automation. All of these things excite us in the tech industry, and government officials are finally starting to get on board. I have been to several smart cities oriented conferences and have seen a lot of great talks. One thing that isn’t being discussed enough is privacy. Are we building Big Brother?</p>

<p>There is a lot of talk about the technology and infrastructure, and a lot of talk about the use cases. This is the fun stuff. We need to talk about the hard stuff. Are we building the foundation for an oppressive system? Are citizens willing to trade their data for these proposed benefits? The biggest question I have that isn’t being answered is: are we building these systems to empower citizens or to empower governments? </p>

<p>In a post-Snowden world, these are the important questions. If smart cities are for smart citizens, we need to include citizens in the conversation, and actually listen to their concerns… and there are plenty of concerns.</p>

<p><strong>Transparency</strong></p>

<p>Regardless of how you feel about the Snowden leaks, you would have to admit that they were shocking. Historically, we have enjoyed a certain level of transparency in our justice system. We don’t expect our government to spy on us without probable cause. We have warrants and privacy rights. Two years ago, talking about Big Brother in the Land of the Free earned you a title of “Conspiracy Theorist.” Now there is no denying that there is some level of mass surveillance going on. </p>

<p>I would argue that there would have been considerably less backlash against the NSA if the public had been aware of their practices. There could have been useful discourse around the constitutionality and effectiveness of surveillance. Even though a vast majority of citizens would not directly participate in any sort of debate, it is comforting to know that decisions are not being made behind closed doors. If things are done in the open. Even if a citizen doesn’t plan on going to bat for themselves, they should know that someone potentially could. Privacy advocates need to know what is going on, so that all of us can be protected.</p>

<p>Moving forward, any sort of data collection in public spaces needs to be done transparently. We need to decide what is and isn’t appropriate together as a community. In some cases, it might be enough for the debate to happen in government offices. In other cases there needs to be clear and visible warnings about what kind of collection is going on; especially when someone’s anonymity can be at stake. I see creating simple and legible signage for sensors in public spaces as one of the biggest design challenges for the Internet of Things.</p>

<p><strong>Context</strong></p>

<p>Most citizens know intuitively when security is appropriate and when it is oppressive. We can mostly agree that metal detectors make sense at a courthouse and not a in a public park. Data privacy is no different. I realize that an airport might track my movements through their facilities, but I’m not necessarily comfortable with my city tracking my movements on their streets. This means that broad sweeping laws might not make sense.</p>

<p>The context in which the data will be used is also important. Anonymized collection and analysis of traffic data for the sake of retiming red light cameras and adjusting speed limits is very different from analyzing the driving patterns of individuals. Part of transparency is being clear and honest about intended use. “We are collecting traffic data” is not enough. We deserve to know the difference between “We are collecting anonymized traffic data to improve traffic flow” and “We are collecting data to implicate criminals” because those things are very different.</p>

<p><strong>Consent</strong></p>

<p>Technology has left consent behind. Our current efforts, such as Terms of Service, are fundamentally broken. If no one knows what they are agreeing to, how can you honestly call that consent? Terms of Service will continue to break down as technology moves away from personal devices and towards public infrastructure. We will see graphical user interfaces take a back seat to automation. This means even less opportunities to present users with information. This is another great design challenge for the Internet of Things.</p>

<p>Ideally, we should be setting our own terms. We own our data, and we should be able to tell services what they are allowed to do with it. Currently, services tell us what they are going to do with it, and that’s only if we’re lucky. Often, data collection happens with zero permission and zero consent. This is the equivalent of “Well, she didn’t say ‘no’” counting as sexual consent. It’s ridiculous, it’s not good enough, and we should never accept that. </p>

<p><strong>Options</strong></p>

<p>Citizens deserve options when they are uncomfortable with data collection, especially when dealing with public resources. If I don’t like Facebook’s privacy policy, I can delete my account. The lines get blurrier when we’re talking about public transit, parks, and sidewalks. Citizen’s shouldn’t have to opt-out of using their own resources. We should be able to choose to only share our data if it is anonymized, or if it is going to open data projects, or choose to opt out entirely. If data collection is being done in such a way that does not allow for options or an opt-out, maybe we should be questioning that method of data collection.</p>

<p><strong>Calling All Privacy Advocates</strong></p>

<p>The Internet of Things for cities is a real thing. Sensors are being installed constantly and more and more data is being collected. Technology is moving fast than legislation and public discourse. Trying to stop the progress is most likely futile, but we can certainly influence how and when these solutions are implemented. Traditionally, designers have been advocates for the user. We need to become advocates for citizens now. Designers should be working hand in hand with citizens policy makers, lawyers, and engineers to ensure that privacy is valued in smart cities. Governments should not be acting as if these resources are theirs. The streets, parks, and sidewalks of our cities belong to us, the citizens. It is the government’s job to manage and maintain them. That does not give them the right to surveil and collect without any oversight or permission from its citizens. Smart cities are great, but the end goal should be smart citizens.</p>
