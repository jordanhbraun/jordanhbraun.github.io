        <title>Designs that Pop!</title>
        <description>&lt;p&gt;My blog posts and work samples focus almost entirely on function, and rarely mention form. I don’t often write about visual design, because people more qualified than me have already done most of the heavy lifting. I try to focus my effort on creating value by solving problems that are unique to the project I am working on.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;This doesn’t mean that I don’t appreciate, enjoy, and strive for beautiful designs. My gut and my idols (Buckminster Fuller, Dieter Rams, Christopher Alexander, Charles Eames, etc), seem to agree that form synthesizes around function.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;blockquote&gt;
  &lt;p&gt;“When I am working on a problem, I never think about beauty but when I have finished, if the solution is not beautiful, I know it is wrong.”&lt;/p&gt;

  &lt;p&gt;-R. Buckminster Fuller&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/blockquote&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Principles and Best Practices&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Many things that you might think of as “designs that pop” or aesthetic decisions, are actually decisions about function. Beautiful typography is a function of legibility. Font size, line height, margins, and weight are all dictated by the human eye and visual processing. Typographic principles guide us towards the proper typography for the job. Principles exist for layout, color, logos… you name it! Within these principles there’s some wiggle room for style, but it’s no different than the wiggle room engineers enjoy within their functional principles or that accountants enjoy within the Generally Accepted Accounting Principles (GAAP).&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;img src=&quot;/images/badtypography.png&quot; alt=&quot;Bad Typography&quot; /&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;img src=&quot;/images/badtypography2.png&quot; alt=&quot;Bad Typography 2&quot; /&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Believe it or not, these sites prioritize form over function. The designers obviously prioritized their own misguided aesthetic preferences over legibility and usability. The result is both ugly and unusable.
&lt;br /&gt;
&lt;br /&gt;
&lt;br /&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;img src=&quot;/images/goodtypography.png&quot; alt=&quot;Good Typography&quot; /&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;img src=&quot;/images/goodtypography1.png&quot; alt=&quot;Good Typography 2&quot; /&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;These designers let function dictate form. The result is legibility, usability, and focus. They also happen to be beautiful, and are often used as examples of companies that value design. Apple and Medium don’t try to reinvent the wheel. They use tried and true design principles for legibility, usability, and focus. 
&lt;br /&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Design is a science with some art sprinkled on top, not the other way around.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Cleanliness and Simplicity&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Humans like things that we can understand, and we’re afraid of things that we don’t. When things are clean and simple, they are easier to understand. When they are cluttered and complex, they are more difficult to understand. Clutter and complexity create fear, anxiety, and distraction. Those things discourage use. This doesn’t mean that a design can’t be colorful, playful, or even flashy. It just means that we should be mindful of things like white space, grids, and the amount of content displayed.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;img src=&quot;/images/dirtyengine.png&quot; alt=&quot;Dirty Engine&quot; /&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;img src=&quot;/images/cleanengine.png&quot; alt=&quot;Clean Engine&quot; /&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Which of these engines do you think runs better? Which would you prefer to interact with? Which one is more aesthetically pleasing? Unless you’re diehard for Ford over GM, the answer to all of those questions is probably the second image. It’s aesthetics don’t make it run better. The fact that it has been meticulously built and maintained to run well (function) makes it pretty (form). This also makes it easier to work on and easier to learn about. It is inviting and isn’t as scary to explore, and that is a good thing in interface design.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Trends in Design&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Design trends are largely dictated by cultural changes, technological advances, and scientific discovery. Design trends are not created by a consortium of creatives. Why are light font-weights and color gradients in style right now? Because our screen technology advanced to the pixel density necessary for thin lines and color gradients to look smooth. Why is skeuomorphism going away? Because of a cultural change where digital natives no longer need visual cues to a real world equivalent to understand an interface. Flashy sites were popular when the Internet was new and exciting. Now minimalist designs cut through the noise.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;img src=&quot;/images/ornateteapot.png&quot; alt=&quot;Ornate Teapot&quot; /&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;img src=&quot;/images/minimalteapot.png&quot; alt=&quot;Minimalist Teapot&quot; /&gt; &lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Before the industrial revolution, fancy engraved metal goods were all the rage. The craftsmanship required to create these ornate pieces signaled quality and attention to detail. New manufacturing techniques made it cheap and easy to create ornate designs with metal. Eventually, manufacturers realized that they could cover up impurities in the materials with ornamentation. Consumers caught on, and contemporary minimalist designs became the new face of luxury while overly ornate designs are viewed as tacky or gaudy.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;It’s worth noting that neither of these design trends are “wrong”. Each seems to be a well made and well designed teapot that serves its function well. They fit the manufacturing practices and cultural norms of their times. &lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;How I Think About Visual Design&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;My focus as a designer has always been on things like users, features, product focus, and the system as a whole. Often, these concerns overlap with visual design decisions. I know that if I truly understand the users and the product, then the visuals will be easy. Paying attention to what I’ve outlined above: &lt;em&gt;principles and best practices, simplicity, and design trends&lt;/em&gt; means that 95% of the visual decisions have been made for me. If I am designing for a platform with a strong design language, such as iOS or Android, then there are even more principles to help guide the visual design. If I am designing for a company with strong branding and style guidelines, then there are even less decisions to be made.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The remaining visual design decisions come down to what I think is best for the project. Ideally, this is guided by empathy for the user, but there might be some personal preference sprinkled in. &lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;In short, I care very much about creating beautiful designs. If I do a good job understanding the function, then the form will manifest itself beautifully.&lt;/p&gt;

        <title>Jargon Can Destroy Projects</title>
        <description>&lt;p&gt;The world of business and technology is full of jargon. There are buzz words, acronyms, and industry specific terms. In theory, this kind of jargon exists to make communication faster and easier. In practice, it creates inconsistent expectations and unclear objectives in the workplace. I have first hand experience with disappointed clients whose definitions of terms like “MVP” and “prototype” are not the same as mine.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The truth about these terms is that the more they are used, the more watered down they become. I’m not even sure what “UX” means anymore, and I’m in the field! I used to feel like it was my mission to learn the true meaning of these terms and teach them to others. Take it from me, it’s a losing battle. I found a better path that leads to consistent expectations and happy teams… I play stupid.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Well, my ego might be a little too big to actually play stupid, but I ask for and present clarification frequently. Even if I know what the jargon means, I explain what it means to me and ask them to clarify what it means to them. I have a mental list of red-flag words that have bitten me in the ass before. A few of them are:&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;ul&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;UX&lt;/li&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;Wireframes&lt;/li&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;Agile&lt;/li&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;Prototype&lt;/li&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;MVP&lt;/li&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;Mockup&lt;/li&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;Signed Off&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The more experience I gain, the less faith I have in this kind of jargon. The perceived meaning of some of these terms is so inconsistent, that sometimes I question my own understanding. I’ve finally arrived at the conclusion that everyone’s definition is equally incorrect and the terms mean nothing. My life is easier now, and my relationship with clients and teams is better. &lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Now that I have given up on jargon, here is how a typical conversation with a client might go:&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;CLIENT:&lt;/strong&gt; Will you be completing wireframes for the new screens?&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;ME:&lt;/strong&gt; Yes. My definition of a wireframe is a very simple drawing which demonstrates general layout and page content. It would likely be in black and white, it would not be pixel perfect, and it would not reflect final fonts or iconography. The wireframes would be accompanied by documentation to help the team understand the changes and new behaviors. Is that what you’re expecting?&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;CLIENT:&lt;/strong&gt; That makes sense, but when do I get to see the pixel perfect stuff?&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;ME:&lt;/strong&gt; I usually call that a mockup. Those will be completed shortly after wireframes are reviewed and approved. I can hand those off as photoshop files, or I can write the basic markup. That depends on your team’s needs and the complexity of the pages. Let’s schedule a wireframe review, then a mockup review 2 weeks later.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Another conversation I frequently have goes like this:&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;CLIENT:&lt;/strong&gt; We need a UX designer and someone recommended you.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;ME:&lt;/strong&gt; Great! I tend to specialize in user research and prototyping. I also have a lot of experience with laying out pages. My biggest value is translating abstract business requirements and user research into concrete product requirements. Does that sound like the sort of stuff you need?&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;CLIENT:&lt;/strong&gt; That sounds great, but I also need a logo, branding, and a really sexy app.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;ME:&lt;/strong&gt; I can help with that, but it’s not really my forte. I would recommend hiring someone like myself, along with someone who specializes in that sort of graphics work. If you don’t have the budget for both, and the graphics are more important to you, I know some great designers whom I’d be happy to recommend.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Both of these conversations illustrate how much more talking I have to do now, but it’s totally worth it. The first conversation aligns everyone’s expectations. The second conversation does the same thing, and even though it could cost me the job, it’s worth it. That project would have been frustrating for both me and the client. &lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Ideally, most of these conversations and clarifications happen before a contract starts, but I don’t stop there. Throughout the project, I continue to ignore jargon and opt for the long winded approach. I consider it an investment that pays dividends. Expectations are consistently understood and objectives are met for the entire life of the project. Every team member involved knows exactly what is going on.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;“MVP” sounds a lot cooler than “an extremely simplified version of your product, that is not made to scale well or handle edge cases, but which helps prove some of our biggest assumptions,” but happy clients and honest work pays my bills.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;hr /&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Just for fun, here’s what some of my favorite jargon tends to mean in the real world:&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;ul&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;&lt;strong&gt;UX:&lt;/strong&gt; wildcard term that could mean literally anything to anyone&lt;/li&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Wireframes:&lt;/strong&gt; Pixel perfect mockups with a strong emphasis on typography and iconography&lt;/li&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Agile:&lt;/strong&gt; Waterfall, but we waste 20 minutes of your morning.&lt;/li&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Prototype:&lt;/strong&gt; Launchable product that magically costs half as much to design and build&lt;/li&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;&lt;strong&gt;MVP:&lt;/strong&gt; A product with as much functionality as Facebook in its 4th year&lt;/li&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Mockup:&lt;/strong&gt; A document that makes clients forget every decision they’ve ever made or approved&lt;/li&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Signed Off:&lt;/strong&gt; The designer loses their ability to make changes, but the client retains theirs&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;

        <title>Privacy in Smart Cities</title>
        <description>&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;“Smart Cities” mostly means “Smart Governments”&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Tech and local governments are very gung-ho about “smart cities” right now. The basic concepts that add up to a smart city are connectivity, open data, and sensor-driven intelligence/automation. All of these things excite us in the tech industry, and government officials are finally starting to get on board. I have been to several smart cities oriented conferences and have seen a lot of great talks. One thing that isn’t being discussed enough is privacy. Are we building Big Brother?&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;There is a lot of talk about the technology and infrastructure, and a lot of talk about the use cases. This is the fun stuff. We need to talk about the hard stuff. Are we building the foundation for an oppressive system? Are citizens willing to trade their data for these proposed benefits? The biggest question I have that isn’t being answered is: are we building these systems to empower citizens or to empower governments? &lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;In a post-Snowden world, these are the important questions. If smart cities are for smart citizens, we need to include citizens in the conversation, and actually listen to their concerns… and there are plenty of concerns.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;br /&gt;	&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Transparency&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Regardless of how you feel about the Snowden leaks, you would have to admit that they were shocking. Historically, we have enjoyed a certain level of transparency in our justice system. We don’t expect our government to spy on us without probable cause. We have warrants and privacy rights. Two years ago, talking about Big Brother in the Land of the Free earned you a title of “Conspiracy Theorist.” Now there is no denying that there is some level of mass surveillance going on. &lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;I would argue that there would have been considerably less backlash against the NSA if the public had been aware of their practices. There could have been useful discourse around the constitutionality and effectiveness of surveillance. Even though a vast majority of citizens would not directly participate in any sort of debate, it is comforting to know that decisions are not being made behind closed doors. If things are done in the open. Even if a citizen doesn’t plan on going to bat for themselves, they should know that someone potentially could. Privacy advocates need to know what is going on, so that all of us can be protected.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Moving forward, any sort of data collection in public spaces needs to be done transparently. We need to decide what is and isn’t appropriate together as a community. In some cases, it might be enough for the debate to happen in government offices. In other cases there needs to be clear and visible warnings about what kind of collection is going on; especially when someone’s anonymity can be at stake. I see creating simple and legible signage for sensors in public spaces as one of the biggest design challenges for the Internet of Things.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Context&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Most citizens know intuitively when security is appropriate and when it is oppressive. We can mostly agree that metal detectors make sense at a courthouse and not a in a public park. Data privacy is no different. I realize that an airport might track my movements through their facilities, but I’m not necessarily comfortable with my city tracking my movements on their streets. This means that broad sweeping laws might not make sense.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The context in which the data will be used is also important. Anonymized collection and analysis of traffic data for the sake of retiming red light cameras and adjusting speed limits is very different from analyzing the driving patterns of individuals. Part of transparency is being clear and honest about intended use. “We are collecting traffic data” is not enough. We deserve to know the difference between “We are collecting anonymized traffic data to improve traffic flow” and “We are collecting data to implicate criminals” because those things are very different.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Consent&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Technology has left consent behind. Our current efforts, such as Terms of Service, are fundamentally broken. If no one knows what they are agreeing to, how can you honestly call that consent? Terms of Service will continue to break down as technology moves away from personal devices and towards public infrastructure. We will see graphical user interfaces take a back seat to automation. This means even less opportunities to present users with information. This is another great design challenge for the Internet of Things.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Ideally, we should be setting our own terms. We own our data, and we should be able to tell services what they are allowed to do with it. Currently, services tell us what they are going to do with it, and that’s only if we’re lucky. Often, data collection happens with zero permission and zero consent. This is the equivalent of “Well, she didn’t say ‘no’” counting as sexual consent. It’s ridiculous, it’s not good enough, and we should never accept that. &lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Options&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Citizens deserve options when they are uncomfortable with data collection, especially when dealing with public resources. If I don’t like Facebook’s privacy policy, I can delete my account. The lines get blurrier when we’re talking about public transit, parks, and sidewalks. Citizen’s shouldn’t have to opt-out of using their own resources. We should be able to choose to only share our data if it is anonymized, or if it is going to open data projects, or choose to opt out entirely. If data collection is being done in such a way that does not allow for options or an opt-out, maybe we should be questioning that method of data collection.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Calling All Privacy Advocates&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The Internet of Things for cities is a real thing. Sensors are being installed constantly and more and more data is being collected. Technology is moving fast than legislation and public discourse. Trying to stop the progress is most likely futile, but we can certainly influence how and when these solutions are implemented. Traditionally, designers have been advocates for the user. We need to become advocates for citizens now. Designers should be working hand in hand with citizens policy makers, lawyers, and engineers to ensure that privacy is valued in smart cities. Governments should not be acting as if these resources are theirs. The streets, parks, and sidewalks of our cities belong to us, the citizens. It is the government’s job to manage and maintain them. That does not give them the right to surveil and collect without any oversight or permission from its citizens. Smart cities are great, but the end goal should be smart citizens.&lt;/p&gt;

        <title>Why I Won&#39;t Design Without Testing</title>
        <description>&lt;p&gt;When I am contracted, it is because I am needed as a design expert. No one is hiring me to make my best guess; they are hiring me to apply the design process to their problem. They might not know that; they might not even know what the design process is. That’s OK, I don’t know what the accounting process is, but I am sure my accountant follows it.That’s what an expert is. An expert is someone who can effective apply their craft. Shooting from the hip, or “just having an eye for it,” is not an expertise. &lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Testing is a crucial part of the design process. If you’re not testing, you’re guessing. I don’t feel comfortable guessing when people are paying me money to solve their problems. Even if I client requests that I skip research, prototyping, and testing, I can’t make my self do it. They don’t understand the design process, that is why they are contracting a designer. I can’t do my job effectively without testing, and I refuse to do my job poorly.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;I view design as the science of problem solving, so it seems logical to use the scientific method to solve design problems. The most effective way for me to explain the importance of research, prototyping, and testing in the design process is to show what the design process looks like with and without it.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;div style=&quot;width:50%; float:left&quot;&gt;
	&lt;p style=&quot;text-align:center&quot;&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Scientific Method&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
	&lt;hr class=&quot;small&quot; /&gt;	
	&lt;ul&gt;
		&lt;li&gt;Observe&lt;/li&gt;
		&lt;li&gt;Hypothesize&lt;/li&gt;
		&lt;li&gt;Experiment&lt;/li&gt;
		&lt;li&gt;Analyze&lt;/li&gt;
		&lt;li&gt;Conclude&lt;/li&gt;
	&lt;/ul&gt;
&lt;/div&gt;

&lt;div style=&quot;width:50%; float:left&quot;&gt;
	&lt;p style=&quot;text-align:center&quot;&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Bullshit Method&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
	&lt;hr class=&quot;small&quot; /&gt;	
	&lt;ul&gt;
		&lt;li&gt;Hypothesize&lt;/li&gt;
		&lt;li&gt;Conclude&lt;/li&gt;
		&lt;br /&gt;
		&lt;br /&gt;
		&lt;br /&gt;
		&lt;br /&gt;
	&lt;/ul&gt;
&lt;/div&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The Bullshit Method is not a problem solving framework, it’s the same framework people use to pick numbers for the lotto. Guessing is not effective. Adding white boards, post it notes, and wireframes into the mix doesn’t mean you’re not guessing. Testing is the answer. Test early, test often, test with users, test lo-fi, test high-fi, never stop testing. You will find the right answers with the scientific method. It cured polio and has helped us understand quantum physics, it is a good methodology.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;I have had many clients ask me to skip straight to UI design with no research or testing, and I just can’t do it. I need my tools to do my job. I work with a lot of startups, and I know that time and money are both in short supply. Testing is &lt;strong&gt;not&lt;/strong&gt; something that you should skip to speed up the process. Reduce scope. Scope reduction is the only way to effectively save time and money without hurting quality. Removing testing from your process to save time is like throwing the bucket overboard to save a sinking ship. Throw some treasure overboard, not the one thing that can save you.&lt;/p&gt;

        <title>Design Science</title>
        <description>&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;We are designers, not artists.&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;If we want to be great designers we need to start behaving more like scientists and less like artists. Design is not applied art; design is the science of problem solving. This is not an expression of our own thoughts, we are creating real solutions for real people.We are trying to solve problems for real people. We are not working in a closed studio in anticipation of a gallery opening. Testing isn’t part of the process; testing is the process. We need to be design scientists.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Scientists know what’s up.&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;We have a lot of lessons to learn from scientists. Their process and their mindset suits our goals well. Their process is continuous and cyclical, just like that word that we like to throw around: iterative. They embrace failure. This is just a buzz phrase in the design and startup world, but its reality for scientists. In the world of science, failure is every bit as important as success, as long as learning is happening. Scientists don’t design experiments stacked to succeed, they design experiments to isolate variables and learn. I’ve seen plenty of user tests designed to prove the hypotheses, this is bad design. Validation needs to go both ways, or you’re just wasting time and money.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;If we want to be design scientists, and we acknowledge that testing is our process, then what does that process look like? The scientific method, of course!&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Observe&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;This part is up to you. Get out there and observe some people. Evaluate your product. Do some daydreaming. Discover your design problem.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Hypothesis&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Brainstorm your heart out. This is the fun part. A lot of people make the mistake of stopping here, or going straight to build after brainstorming. These are assumptions that need validated.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Experiment&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Build whatever you need to build and put it in front of people! Don’t build more than you have to, we just want to validate our assumptions as quickly as possible, so that we can make another run through this cycle. Keep your build focused on the test. &lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Analysis&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Now it’s time to evaluate what you’ve learned. Did the experiment hit its success criteria? Why or why not? New questions should be arising, which leads us back to our first step: the formulation of a question.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Testing takes you where you need to be&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The whole process is the test. It is a cycle of learning and constant improvement. It is not something you do before or after a build. The build is something you do to support the test that leads us closer to our goal: better solutions. If you’re just testing at the beginning or the end of a build then your process is not a science. &lt;/p&gt;

        <title>There is No Secret</title>
        <description>&lt;p&gt;Tips for success, lifehacks, habits of successful people… it’s all bullshit, and everyone should stop wasting their time reading and writing those articles. There is no secret sauce for effectiveness, success, or productivity. This may come as a shock to many, but it all comes down to hard work. Having a hard time focusing? You just need to try harder. Want to get twice as much done? Work twice as much.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;How many articles can possibly be written about getting enough sleep, exercising, and eating healthy? Why are people consuming this? I have a sneaking suspicion that it all comes down to &lt;a href=&quot;http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Ergophobia&quot;&gt;ergophobia&lt;/a&gt;. Most people aren’t hard workers. The startup community is plagued with talkers and brainstormers. Reading articles about working feels like working, but it’s not. Only working is working. So here’s my one tip for success: Work harder.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Work longer hours, get up earlier, go out less, do whatever it takes. Your dad was right when he went on rants about elbow grease and gumption. Hard work pays off. Elon Musk and Richard Branson aren’t sitting around reading dumbass articles on Buzzfeed and Lifehacker… they’re working, they’re crushing it, they know that there is no secret sauce.&lt;/p&gt;

        <title>Organizing UX Knowledge with Trello</title>
        <description>&lt;p&gt;The design process can be messy and chaotic. I’m a fan of any tool or procedure that helps me clean up and focus my workflow. I use a method of organizing knowledge in UX projects that I find to be simple and valuable, especially when working collaboratively.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;First, I try to get everyone involved in the project thinking in terms of unknowns, assumptions, and facts. Just doing this does wonders for communication, planning, and prioritization. Our goal will be to turn unknowns into assumptions, then into facts. I find &lt;a href=&quot;http://www.trello.com&quot;&gt;Trello&lt;/a&gt; to be the perfect tool for organizing and manipulating this information. I create 3 lists: Unknowns, Assumptions, and Facts. Then I create cards in each list for pieces information relevant to the project.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Unknowns:&lt;/strong&gt; We don’t know.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;User behaviors that we don’t understand and questions that we have about the problem we’re solving.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Assumptions:&lt;/strong&gt; We think we know.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Assumptions and predictions that we have made about the user. They are usually related to the user’s motivations or how the user will interact with the product.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Facts:&lt;/strong&gt; We know.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The only way to make it on to this list is through testing, no excuses. Scientific facts are permitted, but common social assumptions should be tested and validated.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Bringing it all home&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Cards can be moved from unknowns to assumptions to facts through observation, testing, and validation. Follow the scientific method (&lt;em&gt;See post:&lt;/em&gt; &lt;a href=&quot;http://www.jhbraun.com/2014/11/20/Design-Science/&quot;&gt;Design Science: Testing is the process&lt;/a&gt;.) Unknowns should be observed and hypotheses (assumptions) should be formed. Assumptions should be tested and either turned into facts or back into unknowns.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Trello has great iOS, Android, and Windows 8 apps. Collaboration is easy. Modifying cards and dragging them from list to list is simple. You can make comments on cards and attach files. It’s everything that I love about white boards and post-it notes, but digital.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;em&gt;(Disclaimer: I currently have no affiliation with Trello, but we would love for that to change.)&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
