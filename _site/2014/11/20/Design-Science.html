    <p><strong>We are designers, not artists.</strong></p>

<p>If we want to be great designers we need to start behaving more like scientists and less like artists. Design is not applied art; design is the science of problem solving. This is not an expression of our own thoughts, we are creating real solutions for real people.We are trying to solve problems for real people. We are not working in a closed studio in anticipation of a gallery opening. Testing isn’t part of the process; testing is the process. We need to be design scientists.</p>

<p><strong>Scientists know what’s up.</strong></p>

<p>We have a lot of lessons to learn from scientists. Their process and their mindset suits our goals well. Their process is continuous and cyclical, just like that word that we like to throw around: iterative. They embrace failure. This is just a buzz phrase in the design and startup world, but its reality for scientists. In the world of science, failure is every bit as important as success, as long as learning is happening. Scientists don’t design experiments stacked to succeed, they design experiments to isolate variables and learn. I’ve seen plenty of user tests designed to prove the hypotheses, this is bad design. Validation needs to go both ways, or you’re just wasting time and money.</p>

<p>If we want to be design scientists, and we acknowledge that testing is our process, then what does that process look like? The scientific method, of course!</p>

<p><strong>Observe</strong></p>

<p>This part is up to you. Get out there and observe some people. Evaluate your product. Do some daydreaming. Discover your design problem.</p>

<p><strong>Hypothesis</strong></p>

<p>Brainstorm your heart out. This is the fun part. A lot of people make the mistake of stopping here, or going straight to build after brainstorming. These are assumptions that need validated.</p>

<p><strong>Experiment</strong></p>

<p>Build whatever you need to build and put it in front of people! Don’t build more than you have to, we just want to validate our assumptions as quickly as possible, so that we can make another run through this cycle. Keep your build focused on the test. </p>

<p><strong>Analysis</strong></p>

<p>Now it’s time to evaluate what you’ve learned. Did the experiment hit its success criteria? Why or why not? New questions should be arising, which leads us back to our first step: the formulation of a question.</p>

<p><strong>Testing takes you where you need to be</strong></p>

<p>The whole process is the test. It is a cycle of learning and constant improvement. It is not something you do before or after a build. The build is something you do to support the test that leads us closer to our goal: better solutions. If you’re just testing at the beginning or the end of a build then your process is not a science. </p>
