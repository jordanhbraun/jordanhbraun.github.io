Interaction design for a large consumer technology company in Cupertino, California. I designed interactions and interfaces for a complex supply chain tool to be used by both internal users and international suppliers.

The big picture goal of the project was to track the makeup of all materials used in the supply chain, to improve safety for the environment, workers, and consumers.

I worked as a lead designer on this project, which was a joint effort of the Information Systems and Environmental Technology teams. I helped define business requirements, then translate them into design and technical requirements. I also documented new interactions and interfaces in detail, with descriptions, wireframes, and diagrams.

I am bound by a strong non-disclosure agreement for this project. Please contact me for more information if you are interested, and I will answer whatever questions I can: <a href="mailto:jordan@jhbraun.com">jordan@jhbraun.com</a>
