Empeopled is a content aggregation and discussion site. The most interesting thing about Empeopled is it's "goverance" features.

Designing Empeopled was a collaborative effort. I was involved in user research, prototyping, interaction design, and UI design. The project was fast paced, fun, and low budget. They are my #1 Favorite All-Time Client. Great guys to work with, had a blast.

**Research**

The long-term goal of Empeopled is to create self-governing virtual city-states. Our initial sights were set on creating a place where people could have intellectual and deep discussions. We set out to learn how deep discussions work, where they happen, and why they don't happen on the internet.

We learned that great discussions happen when their is intelligent moderation, a topic worth discussing, a safe environment, and feedback from peers. So, that's what we tried to build for version one.

**A Virtual Society**

If the long-term goal was to create a virtual society, we wanted to start to lay the groundwork. We chose a newspaper as our metaphor and inspiration. Newspapers are clean and simple. They are a container for a variety of types of information. The purpose of newspaper is to keep citizens informed and engaged, so it seemed like a perfect fit.

We then started exploring all sorts of other features that riffed on the idea of a virtual society. We created a bitcoin treasury, elections, polls, and a variety of other features. Iterations were fast and fun. If we had a decent idea, we threw it out there and saw what happened.

**Current State**

Empeopled continues to function and grow. There is a tight knit and engaged community. It is an experimental concept, and we continue to iterate.
