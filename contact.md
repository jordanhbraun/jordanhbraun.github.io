Please talk to me about philosophy, ethics, art, politics, design, history, or science.

If you're building something that undermines the government, reach out to me on Jitsi. I want to hear about it.

I love working with start-ups, but I don't buy into the start-up culture with ping-pong tables and constant happy hours. If you have someone on your team that you call a ninja or a rock-star, don't talk to me.
